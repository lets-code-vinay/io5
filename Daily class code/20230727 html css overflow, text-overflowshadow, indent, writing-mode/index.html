        She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she
        went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to
        herself, oh dear, how uneasy I feel to-day, and at other times I like
        being with grandmother so much. She called out, "Good morning," but
        received no answer. So she went to the bed and drew back the curtains.
        There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and
        looking very strange. "Oh, grandmother," she said, "what big ears you
        have." "The better to hear you with, my child," was the reply. "But,
        grandmother, what big eyes you have," she said. "The better to see you
        with, my dear." "But, grandmother, what large hands you have." "The
        better to hug you with." "Oh, but, grandmother, what a terrible big
        mouth you have." "The better to eat you with." And scarcely had the wolf
        said this, than with one bound he was out of bed and swallowed up Little
        Red Riding Hood. When the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down
        again in the bed, fell asleep and began to snore very loud. The huntsman
        was just passing the house, and thought to himself, how the old woman is
        snoring. I must just see if she wants anything. So he went into the
        room, and when he came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it.
        "Do I find you here, you old sinner," said he. "I have long sought you."
        Then just as he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the
        wolf might have devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be
        saved, so he did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut
        open the stomach of the sleeping wolf. When he had made two snips, he
        saw the Little Red Riding Hood shining, and then he made two snips more,
        and the little girl sprang out, crying, "Ah, how frightened I have been.
        How dark it was inside the wolf." And after that the aged grandmother
        came out alive also, but scarcely able to breathe. Little Red Riding
        Hood, however, quickly fetched great stones with which they filled the
        wolf's belly, and when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones
        were so heavy that he collapsed at once, and fell dead.
