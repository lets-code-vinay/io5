      Jets are often faster than turboprops, making them attractive for business
      people who need to reach a destination in the shortest possible amount of
      time. Like other general aviation aircraft, jets typically use small
      community airports.

      During the 1920s and 1930s a number of approaches were tried. A variety of
      motorjet, turboprop, pulsejet and rocket powered aircraft were designed.
      Rocket-engine research was being carried out in Germany and the first
      aircraft to fly under rocket power was the Lippisch Ente, in 1928.[4] The
      Ente had previously been flown as a glider. The next year, in 1929, the
      Opel RAK.1 became the first purpose-built rocket aircraft to fly. The
      turbojet was invented in the 1930s, independently by Frank Whittle and
      later Hans von Ohain. The first turbojet aircraft to fly was the Heinkel
      He 178, on August 27, 1939 in Rostock (Germany), powered by von Ohain's
      design.[5][6] This was largely a proof of concept, as the problem of
      "creep" (metal fatigue caused by the high temperatures within the engine)
      had not been solved, and the engine quickly burned out. Von Ohain's
      design, an axial-flow engine, as opposed to Whittle's centrifugal flow
      engine, was eventually adopted by most manufacturers by the 1950s.[7][8]
      The first flight of a jet-propelled aircraft to come to public attention
      was the Italian Caproni Campini N.1 motorjet prototype which flew on
      August 27, 1940.[9] It was the first jet aircraft recognised by the
      Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (at the time the German He 178
      program was still kept secret). Campini began development of the motorjet
      in 1932; it differed from a true turbojet in that the air was driven
      through by a piston engine, instead of the exhaust gas, a much more
      complex solution.

      The British experimental Gloster E.28/39 first flew on May 15, 1941,
      powered by Sir Frank Whittle's turbojet.[10] The United States Bell XP-59A
      flew on October 1, 1942, using two examples of a version of the Whittle
      engine built by General Electric. The Meteor was the first production jet,
      with the first orders for production examples being made on 8 August
      1941,[11] the prototype first flying on 5 March 1943 and the first
      production aircraft flying on 12 January 1944,[12] while the first orders
      for production Me 262 aircraft were not issued until 25 May 1943,[13] and
      the first production Me 262 did not fly until 28 March 1944[14] despite
      the Me 262 program having started earlier than that of the Meteor, as
      Projekt 1065, with initial plans drawn up by Waldemar Voigt's design team
      in April 1939. The Messerschmitt Me 262 was the first operational jet
      fighter,[15] manufactured by Germany during World War II and entering
      service on 19 April 1944 with Erprobungskommando 262 at Lechfeld just
      south of Augsburg. An Me 262 scored the first combat victory for a jet
      fighter on 26 July 1944. The Me 262 had first flown on April 18, 1941, but
      mass production did not start until early 1944, with the first squadrons
      operational that year, too late for any effect on the outcome of the World
      War II. While only around 15 Meteors were operational during WW2, up to
      1,400 Me 262 were produced, with 300 entering combat. Only the
      rocket-propelled Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet was a faster operational
      aircraft during the war.[citation needed] Around this time, mid 1944, the
      United Kingdom's Gloster Meteor was being used for defence of the UK
      against the V-1 flying bomb – itself a pulsejet-powered aircraft and
      direct ancestor of the cruise missile – and then ground-attack operations
      over Europe in the last months of the war. In 1944 Germany introduced the
      Arado Ar 234 jet reconnaissance and bomber aircraft into service, though
      chiefly used in the former role, with the Heinkel He 162 Spatz single-jet
      light fighter appearing at the end of 1944. USSR tested its own
      Bereznyak-Isayev BI-1 in 1942, but the project was scrapped by leader
      Joseph Stalin in 1945. The Imperial Japanese Navy also developed jet
      aircraft in 1945, including the Nakajima J9Y Kikka, a modified, and
      slightly smaller version of the Me 262 that had folding wings. By the end
      of 1945, the US had introduced their first jet fighter, the Lockheed P-80
      Shooting Star into service and the UK its second fighter design, the de
      Havilland Vampire.
