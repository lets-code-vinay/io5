      She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she
      went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to
      herself, oh dear, how uneasy I feel to-day, and at other times I like
      being with grandmother so much. She called out, "Good morning," but
      received no answer. So she went to the bed and drew back the curtains.
      There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and
      looking very strange. "Oh, grandmother," she said, "what big ears you
      have." "The better to hear you with, my child," was the reply. "But,
      grandmother, what big eyes you have," she said. "The better to see you
      with, my dear." "But, grandmother, what large hands you have." "The better
      to hug you with." "Oh, but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you
      have." "The better to eat you with." And scarcely had the wolf said this,
      than with one bound he was out of bed and swallowed up Little Red Riding
      Hood. When the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the
      bed, fell asleep and began to snore very loud. The huntsman was just
      passing the house, and thought to himself, how the old woman is snoring. I
      must just see if she wants anything. So he went into the room, and when he
      came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it. "Do I find you
      here, you old sinner," said he. "I have long sought you." Then just as he
      was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have
      devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did not
      fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach of
      the sleeping wolf. When he had made two snips, he saw the Little Red
      Riding Hood shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl
      sprang out, crying, "Ah, how frightened I have been. How dark it was
      inside the wolf." And after that the aged grandmother came out alive also,
      but scarcely able to breathe. Little Red Riding Hood, however, quickly
      fetched great stones with which they filled the wolf's belly, and when he
      awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he
      collapsed at once, and fell dead.
