1. Five numbers are entered from the keyboard into an
   array. The number to be searched is entered through the
   keyboard by the user. Write a program to find if the number to
   be searched is present in the array and if it is present, display
   the number of times it appears in the array.
   // for loop till 5
   // inside loop, prompt to enter number
   // push the number to array
   // if arr.lenght ===5
   // enter number to find inside the array
   // for loop
   // arr[i] == enteredNum

2. Five numbers are entered from the keyboard into an
   array. Write a program to find out how many of them are
   positive, how many are negative, how many are even and how
   many odd.
   - positive,
   - negative,
   - even,
   - odd
3. Write a program to copy the contents of one array into another
   in the reverse order. (with prototype)
   arr1 = [1,2,3,4]
   newArr = [4,3,2,1]
4. Reverse array without using prototypes [4,8,9,2] to [2,9,8,4]
5. Write a simple JavaScript program to join all elements of the following array into a string.
   Sample array : myColor = ["Red", "Green", "White", "Black"];
   Expected Output :
   "Red,Green,White,Black"
   "Red,Green,White,Black"
   "Red+Green+White+Black"
6. Write a JavaScript program to sort the items of an array.
   Sample array : var arr1 = [ -3, 8, 7, 6, 5, -4, 3, 2, 1 ];
   Sample Output : -4,-3,1,2,3,5,6,7,8
   let maxVal = 0;
   arr1[i] > maxVal
      maxVal = arr[i]
7. Write a JavaScript program to find the most frequent item in an array.
   Sample array : var arr1=[3, 'a', 'a', 'a', 2, 3, 'a', 3, 'a', 2, 4, 9, 3];
   Sample Output : a ( 5 times )
8. Write a JavaScript program that accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character. For example if you input 'The Quick Brown Fox' the output should be 'tHE qUICK bROWN fOX'.
9. Write a JavaScript program to remove duplicate items from an array (ignore case sensitivity).
10. We have the following arrays :
    color = ["Blue ", "Green", "Red", "Orange", "Violet", "Indigo", "Yellow "];
    o = ["th","st","nd","rd"]
    Write a JavaScript program to display the colors in the following way :
    "1st choice is Blue ."
    "2nd choice is Green."
    "3rd choice is Red."
    Note : Use ordinal numbers to tell their position.
11. There are two arrays with individual values. Write a JavaScript program to compute the sum of each individual index value in the given array.
    Sample array :
    array1 = [1,0,2,3,4];
    array2 = [3,5,6,7,8,13];
    Expected Output :
    [4, 5, 8, 10, 12, 13]

12. Write a JavaScript program to find duplicate values in a JavaScript array..
13. Write a JavaScript program to flatten a nested (any depth) array. If you pass shallow, the array will only be flattened to a single level.
    Sample Data :
    console.log(flatten([1, [2], [3, [[4]]],[5,6]]));
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    console.log(flatten([1, [2], [3, [[4]]],[5,6]], true));
    [1, 2, 3, [[4]], 5, 6]

14. Write a JavaScript program to compute the union of two arrays.
    Sample Data :
    console.log(union([1, 2, 3], [100, 2, 1, 10]));
    [1, 2, 3, 10, 100]

15. Write a JavaScript function to remove. 'null', '0', '""', 'false', 'undefined' and 'NaN' values from an array.
    Sample array : [NaN, 0, 15, false, -22, '',undefined, 47, null]
    Expected result : [15, -22, 47]

16. Write a JavaScript function to remove a specific element from an array.
    Test data :
    console.log(remove_array_element([2, 5, 9, 6], 5));
    [2, 9, 6]

17. Write a JavaScript function to find an array containing a specific element.
    Test data :
    arr = [2, 5, 9, 6];
    console.log(contains(arr, 5));
    [True]

18. Write a JavaScript script to empty an array while keeping the original.
19. Write a JavaScript function to get the largest element from an unsorted array.
    Test Data :
    console.log( largest([ 43, 56, 23, 189, 88, 90, 99, 52]));
    output: 189
20. Write a JavaScript function to generate an array between two integers of 1 step length.
    Test Data :
    console.log(rangeBetween(4, 7));
    [4, 5, 6, 7]
    console.log(rangeBetween(-4, 7));
    [-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

21. population of a town is 100000. The population of town is increasing by 10% every year. find the population of town after 15years
